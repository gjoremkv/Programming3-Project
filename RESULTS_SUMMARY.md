## 💡 Recommendations

### For Your LaTeX Report

1. **Use the PDF graphs** - They're vector format and will scale perfectly
2. **Copy the LaTeX code** from `graphs/latex_figures.tex`
3. **Highlight key findings**:
   - Parallel processing effectiveness for medium/large images
   - Distributed computing overhead for small images
   - Near-perfect scalability for very large images

### For Further Research

1. **Test even larger images** (50+ MP) to see distributed advantages
2. **Vary the number of workers** (2, 4, 8 workers)
3. **Test network distributed** vs local distributed
4. **Compare with GPU acceleration**
