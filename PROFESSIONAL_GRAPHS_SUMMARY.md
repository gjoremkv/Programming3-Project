## 📈 **Data Interpretation Guide**

### **What Each Graph Shows:**

#### **Performance Trends Visible:**
1. **Small Images** (< 1MP): Sequential often performs best due to low overhead
2. **Medium Images** (1-4MP): Multithreaded shows clear advantages  
3. **Large Images** (15+ MP): Both Multithreaded and Distributed excel

#### **Execution Time Values:**
- **Precise measurements** displayed directly on data points
- **Seconds format** for easy readability (e.g., "2.31s" instead of "2310ms")
- **Consistent scaling** across all operations for fair comparison

#### **Image Size Information:**
- **Exact dimensions** shown on X-axis (e.g., "2560×1440")
- **Megapixel values** displayed for context (e.g., "(3.7MP)")
- **Logical progression** from small to large images

## 🎓 **Perfect for Academic Reports**

### **LaTeX Integration Ready**
```latex

```

### **Report Structure Suggestions**
1. **Edge Detection Analysis**: Discuss computational complexity of edge algorithms
2. **Blur Processing Discussion**: Analyze convolution operation efficiency  
3. **Sharpen Enhancement Study**: Compare enhancement algorithm scalability
4. **Cross-Operation Comparison**: Synthesize findings across all three operations

### **Key Discussion Points**
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Different operations have different computational loads
- **Scalability Analysis**: How each architecture handles increasing image sizes
- **Overhead Assessment**: When distributed processing overhead is justified
- **Practical Applications**: Which method to choose for different scenarios
