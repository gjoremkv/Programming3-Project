# 📊 Graph Updates: Naming & Megapixel Explanation

## 🔧 **Fixed: "Parallel" → "Multithreaded" Naming**

### ✅ **What Changed:**
- **All graphs now show "Multithreaded"** instead of "Parallel"
- **Consistent terminology** throughout the project
- **Better academic terminology** for university reports

### **Updated Elements:**
- **Graph legends**: Now show "Sequential", "Multithreaded", "Distributed"
- **Analysis output**: Console shows "MULTITHREADED" instead of "PARALLEL"
- **Color coding**: Green color now represents "Multithreaded"
- **File compatibility**: Still reads existing CSV data (maps "parallel" → "multithreaded")

## 📏 **Megapixels (MP) Explanation**

### 🎯 **What "(0.01MP)" Means:**

**MP = Megapixels** = Total number of pixels in the image

### **Formula:**
```
Megapixels = (Width × Height) ÷ 1,000,000
```

### **Examples from Your Graphs:**

| Resolution | Calculation | Megapixels | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **100×100** | 100 × 100 = 10,000 | **0.01 MP** | Very small image |
| **640×480** | 640 × 480 = 307,200 | **0.31 MP** | Standard VGA |
| **1920×1080** | 1920 × 1080 = 2,073,600 | **2.07 MP** | Full HD |
| **3876×3999** | 3876 × 3999 = 15,502,524 | **15.5 MP** | High resolution |

### **Why It's Important:**
- **Computational Load**: Higher MP = More pixels to process
- **Performance Impact**: Larger images show better speedup for parallel methods
- **Memory Usage**: More MP = More RAM needed
- **Real-World Context**: Helps understand when each method is best

## 📊 **Updated Graph Features:**

### **1. Speedup Graph Improvements:**
- ✅ **Explanation box** now includes MP definition
- ✅ **Clear examples**: "0.01MP = 100×100 = 10,000 pixels"
- ✅ **Better context**: Shows relationship between image size and performance

### **2. Consistent Naming:**
- ✅ **Sequential** (Red, Circle ○)
- ✅ **Multithreaded** (Green, Square ■) ← **Updated**
- ✅ **Distributed** (Blue, Triangle ▲)

### **3. Academic Quality:**
- ✅ **Professional terminology** suitable for university reports
- ✅ **Clear explanations** for non-technical readers
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** across all 4 graphs

## 🎓 **For Your University Report:**

### **Key Points to Explain:**

1. **Image Size Complexity:**
   - Small images (< 1 MP): Simple processing, overhead dominates
   - Large images (> 10 MP): Complex processing, parallelization beneficial

2. **Performance Scaling:**
   - Sequential: Linear growth with image size
   - Multithreaded: Better scaling due to CPU cores
   - Distributed: Good for very large images despite overhead

3. **Practical Applications:**
   - Photo editing software
   - Medical imaging systems
   - Satellite image processing
   - Video processing pipelines

### **Academic Discussion:**
- **Amdahl's Law**: Why speedup is limited
- **Overhead vs Benefit**: Communication costs in distributed systems
- **Scalability**: When each method is optimal
- **Real-world Impact**: Choosing the right approach

## 🚀 **Ready for Submission:**

Your graphs now have:
- ✅ **Consistent "Multithreaded" terminology**
- ✅ **Clear Megapixel explanations**
- ✅ **Professional academic language**
- ✅ **Educational value** for readers
- ✅ **Complete context** for understanding results

**Perfect for university-level distributed computing analysis! 🎓📊**
